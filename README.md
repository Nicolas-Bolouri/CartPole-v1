# CartPole-v1 Reinforcement Learning Solution

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook detailing the development, training, and evaluation of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent on the CartPole-v1 environment from OpenAI Gym. The notebook employs Q-Learning, a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm, to teach an agent how to successfully balance a pole on a cart.

The solution outlined in the notebook discretizes the CartPole-v1 environment's continuous state space, enabling the implementation of Q-Learning. It meticulously guides through initializing the Q-table, defining the policy for action selection, updating Q-values based on rewards, and iterating this process to improve the agent's performance over time.

### Key Features:
- **Automated dependency installation:** Ensures all necessary libraries and tools are installed for executing the notebook seamlessly.
- **Comprehensive RL agent development:** From discretizing the state space to defining and updating policies based on rewards.
- **Evaluation and rendering:** Demonstrates the agent's effectiveness through cumulative rewards across episodes and renders the agent's performance in the environment.

### How to Use:
To explore and experiment with the notebook:
- **Open in Google Colab:** Directly access the notebook in Google Colab to leverage its compute resources and preconfigured environment. No setup requiredâ€”just run and learn.


For a deep dive into the methodology, results, and insights, open the notebook in Colab and start exploring the interactive code and visualizations.
